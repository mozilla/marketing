# Mozilla Marketing

I like to think of the [books of Mozilla marketing](https://github.com/mozilla/marketing/issues/1) as physical reminders of the "[original](https://www.mozilla.org/book/)" "[Book of Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mozilla)". Like the rest of the web, [this github repo](https://github.com/mozilla/marketing) is being written in erasable ink. Like the rest of the web, I'm asking you to help me write it. I'll write pages in my books, and you write in yours. I'll take pictures of my pages and upload them to [issues](https://github.com/mozilla/marketing/issues), and and I invite you to do the same. Feel free to skip writing with a pen and use the keyboard on your laptop or phone, of course. I do, most of the time.
